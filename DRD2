DRD2 CNS Active Compound Identification and Generation

📄 Overview

This project is a comprehensive cheminformatics workflow focused on the Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), a crucial therapeutic target in Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. The goal is to perform Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling and subsequent de novo molecular generation to identify novel, potent, and brain-penetrant drug candidates.

The entire analysis, from data curation and feature engineering to model training and candidate prioritization, is encapsulated within the DRD2_CNS.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

✨ Key Workflow Steps

Data Curation & Filtering: Retrieve binding data (pIC50/IC50) for the DRD2 receptor (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL217) from the ChEMBL database [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

Molecular Property Calculation: Calculate RDKit descriptors (MW, LogP, TPSA, etc.) and generate Morgan Fingerprints (ECFP-like) for QSAR modeling [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

CNS Drug-Likeness Assessment: Filter the dataset to enrich for high-quality, drug-like, and brain-penetrant molecules using:

QED (Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness) score.

Peifer BBB Rules for Blood-Brain Barrier permeability [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

CNS MPO (Multiparameter Optimization) score [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

QSAR Model Training: Train a machine learning regression model (e.g., using scikit-learn) on the molecular features (descriptors + fingerprints) to accurately predict the binding affinity, $\text{log}(\text{IC}_{50})$ [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

Molecular Generation: Utilize a recurrent neural network (SelfiesRNN) trained on the SELFIES representation of molecules to generate thousands of novel chemical structures [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

Candidate Prioritization: Predict the binding affinity and CNS properties for the generated structures, and filter them to select the most promising novel drug candidates that satisfy potency and brain-penetrant criteria [cite: uploaded:DRD2_CNS.ipynb].

🛠️ Prerequisites

This project is developed in Python and relies heavily on cheminformatics and deep learning libraries.

Python Libraries

The following dependencies are required (often installed in the first notebook cell):

chembl_webresource_client: For accessing and downloading ChEMBL data.

rdkit: The essential toolkit for cheminformatics (molecular manipulation, descriptor calculation, fingerprint generation).

pandas, numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

matplotlib, seaborn: For data visualization and model evaluation plots.

torch: The deep learning framework used for the SelfiesRNN generative model.

selfies: For encoding and decoding molecules in the robust SELFIES format.

scikit-learn: For training the QSAR regression model.

🚀 Installation and Usage

1. Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

# If not already installed, install RDKit using Conda (recommended)
# conda create -n drd2_env python=3.9
# conda activate drd2_env
# conda install -c conda-forge rdkit

# Install other required libraries
pip install chembl_webresource_client pandas matplotlib seaborn torch selfies scikit-learn --quiet


2. Running the Analysis

Download or clone the DRD2_CNS.ipynb notebook.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook DRD2_CNS.ipynb


Execute all cells sequentially. The notebook is designed to be self-contained and run the entire pipeline from beginning to end.

📂 Key Output Files

The execution of the notebook generates several intermediate and final result files:

File Name

Description

drd2_bbb_permeable_high_moderate_qed_binding_500_rdkit.csv

Initial curated training set (filtered for potency, QED, and CNS properties).

DRD2_training_with_fingerprints.csv

Final QSAR training dataset, including the computed Morgan fingerprints.

DRD2_generated_with_predicted_ic50_fingerprints.csv

A large list of novel, generated molecules with their predicted properties.

DRD2_filtered_candidates.csv

The small, highly prioritized list of novel drug candidates that meet all specified potency ($\text{IC}_{50}$) and CNS-MPO criteria.

train_tensor.pt, val_tensor.pt

PyTorch tensors containing the tokenized SELFIES sequences for RNN training.

📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes several critical visualizations for analysis:

Molecular Property Histograms: Visualizing the distributions of TPSA, LogP, MW, QED, and CNS-MPO scores for the curated training set to ensure appropriate data quality.

QSAR Model Performance: A scatter plot of Predicted $\text{log}(\text{IC}_{50})$ vs. Actual $\text{log}(\text{IC}_{50})$ to assess model accuracy ($R^2$, RMSE).

Candidate Property Distributions: Plots demonstrating the properties of the final generated candidates compared to the initial training set, confirming the enrichment of desired characteristics.
