🫀 CardioPredict: Heart Failure Risk Assessment

A lightweight machine learning application to predict patient mortality risk based on clinical parameters.

📝 Description

CardioPredict is a machine learning project designed to assess the risk of death (mortality) in heart failure patients using a set of common clinical features. The core of the project is a Random Forest Classifier trained on high-quality clinical records. It solves the problem of rapid risk stratification in a clinical context, offering a quick, data-driven perspective on a patient's prognosis. The target audience includes medical researchers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals interested in predictive modeling for cardiovascular health.

✨ Features

High Accuracy: Achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the held-out test set for binary classification (survival vs. mortality).

Feature Scaling: Uses StandardScaler to normalize numerical input features, ensuring robust model training.

Robust Model: Implements a Random Forest Classifier, known for its good performance, feature importance ranking, and resistance to overfitting.

Interactive CLI: Provides a simple command-line interface for entering patient data and receiving real-time predictions.

Clear Data Handling: Demonstrates complete data loading, splitting, scaling, training, and evaluation workflows.

🚀 Installation and Setup

To run this prediction model locally, you will need Python (3.8+) and a few standard data science libraries.

Prerequisites

Python (3.8 or higher)

pip (Python package installer)

Step-by-Step Guide

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/CardioPredict.git](https://github.com/your-username/CardioPredict.git)
cd CardioPredict


Download Dataset:

This project requires the heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv file. Ensure this file is placed in the project root directory.

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn


Run the Prediction Script:
The model training, evaluation, and interactive prediction loop are all contained within the script (or the runnable Jupyter Notebook).

jupyter notebook heart_clinicaldata.ipynb
# Alternatively, if converted to a Python script:
# python train_and_predict.py


💻 Usage

The application, when run (either via the notebook or script), will first train the model and display the accuracy. It then enters an interactive loop, prompting you for patient parameters.

Example Console Flow:

Start: The application begins by training and reporting accuracy:

💓 Heart Failure Prediction 💓
📊 Model Accuracy on Test Set: 85.00%


Input Prompt: The system will ask for the 12 clinical parameters:

Enter Age: 60
Enter Creatinine Phosphokinase (U/L): 600
Enter Ejection Fraction (%): 40
... (continue for all 12 features)


Prediction Output: After all inputs, the final prediction is displayed:

✅ Prediction: Low Risk of Mortality (Survival Likely)
# OR
❌ Prediction: High Risk of Mortality (Death Event Likely)
